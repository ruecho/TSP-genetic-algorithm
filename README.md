# TSP Genetic Algorithm  

A genetic algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  

## Features  
- Uses a genetic algorithm to find optimized TSP routes.  
- Implements selection, crossover, and mutation operators.  
- Visualizes the best path found over generations.  

## Usage  
Clone the repository and run the script:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruecho/TSP-genetic-algorithm.git  
cd TSP-genetic-algorithm  
python tsp_ga.py
